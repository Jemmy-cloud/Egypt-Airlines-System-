                Somewhere around <U>1375 years</U> before the birth of <EM>
                    Christ
                </EM>, an Egyptian pharaoh publicly changed his name.

        <FONT COLOR="#000022" SIZE="+2" FACE="Verdana">
            That change signalled a return to long-standing tradition,
            a <U>hallmark of <STRONG>Egyptian</STRONG> culture</U> that
            flourished for more than three thousand years peacefully in the
            rich <EM>Nile River</EM> valley.

            The king had been called Tutankhaton. The last portion of his name,
            aton, was the name for the sun-god, which, in the years before the
            king's reign, had achieved preeminence among the competing deities
            in Egyptian religious tradition.
        </FONT>

        <FONT COLOR="midnightblue" SIZE="+2" FACE="Times">
            The king changed his name to the one by which he is known today --
            <STRONG>TUTANKHAMEN</STRONG> or, more popularly, <EM>King Tut</EM> --
            and ended the brief experiment in monotheism in favor of the older
            religion with its promise of an afterlife.
